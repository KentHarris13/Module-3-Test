The Internet works becuase we have computputers connected to computers and so on (routers are min computers)
-the internet is like the railroad system that connects people or things from far away and has stations(router) that send them to the right destination(server, clients)

there are servers (pretty much computers) and Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. 
When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

inital request (link clciked URL visted), request reaches app server, app code finisheds execution, browser receives HTML, begins processing
HTML processing finishes, Page rendered in browser. (nvm what really happends is the page yeets into reality)
